TYPHP Project
=============

Hello, everyone!
Project made with love for php <3
The goal of project was to get more typing for php syntax with basic syntax development like typescript.
I choose C++ for programming language because of the cross-platform and great background for every time.
I tried to make AST tree for the best experience in code gen.

## How to build nd run
```
mkdir ./build
make
./build/typhp/typhp test.php
```
